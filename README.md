# CarWashSimulation
Situation:
Consider a station that has two cells for washing cars and a parking lot that can hold 10 cars at a time. An arriving customer goes directly to the available cell (or one of the two at random if both are available). Otherwise, he will go to the car park if a space is free. Otherwise it goes to a competing car wash.


The code simulate this situation and try to estimate relevant statistics.
